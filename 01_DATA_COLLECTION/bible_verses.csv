"So then, while her husband is living, if she lives with another man, she will be called an adulteress. But if the husband dies, she is free from the law, so she is not an adulteress if she lives with another man. 4","Thik itu nisena, jodi tai mota jinda thaki kena, dusra ekjon logot thaki jaile tai ke bebichari eneka kobo.

"Therefore, my brothers, you were also made dead to the law through the body of Christ.

"What will we say then? Is the law itself sin? May it never be. However, I would never have known sin, if it were not through the law.

For sin took the opportunity through the commandment and deceived me. Through the commandment it killed me. 12,Kilemane paap pora itu hukum to loikena moike thogai se. Aru hukum dwara moi ke morai dise. 12,,,,
"So the law is holy, and the commandment is holy, righteous, and good. 13","Itu karone kanun to pobitro ase, aru hukum to pobitro ase, aru dharmik aru bhal ase. 13",,,,
"So did what is good become death to me? May it never be.

There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus. 2,Itu karone etiya kun Jisu Khrista te ase taikhan karone ninda kora eku nai. 2,,,,

"For what the law was unable to do because it was weak through the flesh, God did.

Who serves as a soldier at his own expense? Who plants a vineyard and does not eat its fruit? Or who shepherds a flock and does not drink milk from it? 8,Kun sipahi kaam kori kena nijor ke tangkha diye? Kun bagan kora manu bagan kori kena nijor bagan laga guti khabole napare?

"For it is written in the law of Moses, ""Do not put a muzzle on an ox when it is threshing the grain.""

"If others exercised this right from you, do we not have even more? But we did not claim this right. Instead we endured everything rather than be a hindrance to the gospel of Christ. 13","Jodi dusra khan apni uporte kiba pabole adhikar ase koile, apnikhan bi taikhan uporte pabole adhikar ase nohoi?

Do you not know that those who perform sacred duties get their food from the temple? Do you not know that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar? 14,"Apnikhan najane, jun mondir nimite kaam kore, tai to mondir laga kaam khan he khai; aru jun bedi te kha luwa khan sai, tai to bedi laga kha luwa he khai? 14",,,,

For the one who speaks in a tongue does not speak to people but to God.

"Now I wish that you all spoke in tongues. But even more than that, I wish that you would prophesy.

"So it is with you. Since you are eager for the manifestations of the Spirit, seek for the edification of the church so that you might abound. 13","Itu nimite apnikhan jun atma laga bordan bisi lobole itcha kori thaki ase, taikhan utu bordan lobi juntu girja khan laga biswas ke bisi dangor kori dibo. 13",,,,
So the one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret. 14,"Eneka hoile jun ekjon alag bhasha pora kotha kore, tai itu bhasha buja bo paribole nimite prathana koribo lage. 14",,,,
"For if I pray in a tongue, my spirit prays, but my mind is unfruitful. 15","Jodi moi alag bhasha pora prathana kore, moi laga atma bi prathana kore, kintu ami laga bhabona to eku bi nakore. 15",,,,

"Otherwise, if you bless God with the spirit, how will the outsider say ""Amen"" when you are giving thanks if he does not know what you are saying? 17","Nohoile, jodi apni atma pora Isor ke dhanyabad kore, kintu ekjon nabuja manu to kineka apni laga dhanyabad ke “Amen” kobo, kile koile apni ki koi ase tai eku bi nabuje? 17",,,,

I thank God that I speak in tongues more than all of you. 19,Ami Isor ke dhanyabad diye kilekoile moi apnikhan pora bi bisi alag bhasha te kotha kore. 19,,,,
"But in the church I would rather speak five words with my understanding so that I might instruct others, than ten thousand words in a tongue. 20","Kintu girja te dos hajar alag bhasha laga kotha kora pora to juntu pansta kotha ami laga bhabona pora dusra khan ke buja bole pare, itu he kobo. 20",,,,
"Brothers, do not be children in your thinking. Rather, in regard to evil, be like infants. But in your thinking be mature. 21","Bhai khan, apnikhan laga bhabona te bacha nisena nahobi. Itu pora to, biya kaam te bacha nisena hobi, hoile bi bhabona te dangor manu nisena thakibi. 21",,,,
"In the law it is written, ""By men of strange tongues and by the lips of strangers I will speak to this people. Even then they will not hear me,"" says the Lord. 22","Niom laga kitab te eneka likhi kena ase, “Alag bhasha kora manukhan aru alag kotha kowa manukhan ke loikena, Moi itu manukhan ke kotha koribo, Kintu eneka korile bi taikhan moi ke nahunibo, Probhu he koise.” 22",,,,
"So then, tongues are a sign, not to believers, but to unbelievers. But prophecy is for a sign, not for unbelievers, but for believers. 23","Itu nimite, alag bhasha kora khan to ekta chihna ase, biswasi khan karone nohoi, kintu abiswasi khan nimite; hoilebi bhabobani kora khan to abiswasi khan nimite nohoi, kintu biswasi khan nimite ase. 23",,,,
"If, therefore, the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues, and outsiders and unbelievers come in, would they not say that you are insane? 24","Jodi, itu karone, pura biswasi khan eke logote ekta jagate joma hoi aru taikhan sob alag bhasha te kotha koribole shuru hoijai, kintu kunba abiswasi aru bordan nathaka manukhan ahe, taikhan ke dikhi kena apnikhan pagala hoise nakobo naki? 24",,,,
"But if you all were prophesying and an unbeliever or an outsider came in, he would be convicted by all he hears. He would be judged by all that is said. 25","Kintu jodi apnikhan sob bhabobani kori thaki se, kintu kunba bordan nathaka nohoile bi abiswasi apnikhan logote ahe, tai khan laga paap khan sob apnikhan pora koidibo aru apnikhan laga kotha pora taikhan ke bisar koribo, 25",,,,

"What is next then, brothers? When you come together, each one has a psalm, a teaching, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Do everything so that you build up the church. 27","Moi laga bhai khan apni khan ki koribo lage?

"If anyone speaks in a tongue, let there be two or at most three, and each one in turn, and then someone should interpret what is said. 28","Jitia ekjon alag bhasa pora kotha koi, bisi hoilebi duijon nahoile tinjon he kobole lage, aru ekjon to itu laga motlob kobo lage. 28",,,,

For each of you can prophesy one by one so that each one may learn and all may be exhorted. 32,"Kilekoile apnikhan sob ekta piche ekta korikena bhabobani koribo pare, titia sob bujhi bole paribo aru utsah pabo. 32",,,,
For the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. 33,Hosa pora bi bhabobadi khan laga atma to bhabobadi khan nijor laga nichete kaam kore. 33,,,,

But now we do not yet see everything subjected to him. 9","Apni Tai laga theng nichete sob saman khan rakhi dise.” Aru sob Tai laga nichete thaki jaise, Isor pora Tai laga nichete rakhi nadiya eku nai. Kintu amikhan etiya bi sob jinis Tai laga nichete nahi kena thaka dikhi ase. 9",,,,
"But we see him who was made lower than the angels for a little while, Jesus, crowned with glory and honor because of his suffering and death, so that by God's grace he might taste death for everyone. 10","Kintu amikhan Jisu ke dikhise, kun ke sorgoduth laga nichete olop din nimite rakhise, aru Tai dukh aru kosto korikena mora nimite mohima aru sonman laga mukut lagai dise, eneka kora pora Isor laga anugraha dwara Tai sob nimite moribo. 10",,,,
"For it was proper for God, because everything exists for him and through him, to bring many sons to glory. It was proper for him to make the founder of their salvation complete through his sufferings. 11","Kilemane, kun karone aru kun sob jinis ulabole dise, sob nimite dukh kosto pora moribole aru poritran laga cholawta ke mohima te anibole, Tai he yogya asele. 11",,,,
For both the one who sanctifies and those who are sanctified have one source. So he is not ashamed to call them brothers. 12,"Kilemane kun pora sapha kori diye aru kun sapha hoi jai tai khan sob to eke jaga pora ahise. Itu nimite, Tai pora tai khan ke bhaikhan eneka mati bole sorom nohoi. 12",,,,
"He says, ""I will proclaim your name to my brothers, I will sing about you from inside the assembly."" 13","Tai koi, “Moi tumi khan laga naam bhai khan majote koi dibo, Moi manu majot pora tumi khan nimite gana koribo.” 13",,,,
"And again, ""I will trust in him."" And again, ""See, here am I and the children whom God has given me."" 14","Aru bi, “Moi tai ke biswas koribo.” Aru bi, “Sabi, Moi yate ase aru Moi aru Moi laga bacha khan bi yate ase kun Isor pora Moi ke dise.” 14",,,,
"Therefore, since the children share in flesh and blood, he shared in those things in the same way, so that through death he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is, the devil. 15","Aru kineka bacha khan gaw aru khun te eke bhag ase, itu nisena Tai bi bhag loise, aru Tai nijor morija pora he, bhoot, kun logote mrityu laga takot ase, tai ke khotom koribo parise. 15",,,,
This was so that he would free all those who through fear of death lived all their lives in slavery. 16,"Itu pora he, jun khan mrityu ke bhoi kora jibon pora bandhi kena thakise, taikhan ke ajad kori dibole korise. 16",,,,
"For surely it is not the angels he helps, but Abraham's descendants. 17","Tai sorgo te thaka duth khan nimite chinta kora nohoi; kintu, Abraham laga bacha khan nimite chinta thakise. 17",,,,
"So it was necessary for him to become like his brothers in all ways, so that he would be a merciful and faithful high priest in relation to the things of God, and so that he would make propitiation for the people's sins. 18","Itu karone sob kaam te Tai laga bhai khan nisena hobole nimite dorkar thakise, aru itu pora Tai ekjon dayalu aru biswasi moha purohit hobo aru Isor laga ki kaam ase itu sob pura koribo, aru manu laga sob paap to sapha kori dibo. 18",,,,
"Because Jesus himself has suffered and was tempted, he is able to help those who are tempted. 1","Aru kilemane Tai nijor bi porikha korikena dukh paise, Tai kun manu porikha te ase tai ke modot koribole paribo. 1",,,,

"For Jesus has been considered worthy of greater glory than Moses, because the one who builds a house has more honor than the house itself. 4","Jineka ekta ghor pora bi ghor bona manu ke bisi sonman aru mohima hoi, eneka pora Tai he Moses pora bi dangor sonman aru mohima ase. 4",,,,
"For every house is built by someone, but the one who built everything is God. 5","Kilemane ghor to kunba pora bonai, kintu Isor pora he sob bonaise. 5",,,,
"For Moses was faithful as a servant in God's entire house, bearing witness about the things that were to be spoken of in the future. 6","Moses bi Isor laga pura ghor te biswasi ekjon sewak thakise, itu kotha laga gawahi khan hobo nimite jun aha din te hobole ase. 6",,,,
But Christ is faithful as a Son who is in charge of the house of God. We are his house if we hold fast to our courage and the hope of which we boast. 7,Kintu Khrista to Isor pora biswas thaka Chokra ase kun Isor laga pura ghor sai ase.

"Therefore, it is just as the Holy Spirit says: ""Today, if you hear his voice 8","Itu nimite, Pobitro Atma pora bi eneka koise: “Aji, jodi apni Tai laga awaj hune 8",,,,
"do not harden your hearts as in the rebellion, in the time of testing in the wilderness. 9","Mon tan nokoribi, Aru biya kaam nokoribi, Jongol te thaka homoi te porikha kori kena sa nisena. 9",,,,
"This was when your ancestors rebelled by testing me, and when, during forty years, they saw my deeds. 10","Tumi khan laga baba khan pora Moi ke porikha kori kena kotha mana nai, Tai khan Moi chalis saal tak ki kaam korise itu sob dikhise. 10",,,,

"Be careful, brothers, so that among you there will not be anyone with an evil heart of unbelief, a heart that turns away from the living God. 13","Hoshiar hoi jabi, bhai khan, apni khan laga mon te biswas nakora laga biya bhabona nahibo nimite, kilemane itu pora apni khan ke jivit Isor pora dur loi jai. 13",,,,
"Instead, encourage one another daily, as long as it is called ""today,"" so that no one among you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. 14","Kintu, hodai ekjon-ekjon laga mon dangor kori dibi, jiman din ke “aji” matibo, titia apni khan majot kun laga bi mon to paap laga biya kaam pora tan nohobo. 14",,,,

Who was it who heard God and rebelled? Was it not all those who came out of Egypt through Moses? 17,Kilemane kun huni kena kotha mana nai? Tai khan sob ke Moses pora he Egypt pora ulai kena ana nai naki? 17,,,,
"With whom was he angry for forty years? Was it not with those who sinned, whose dead bodies fell in the wilderness? 18","Aru kun logote Tai chalis saal tak khong uthi kena thakise? Paap kora manu khan logote nohoi naki, kun laga mora gaw to jongol te giri kena thakise? 18",,,,

We see that they were not able to enter his rest because of unbelief. 1,Amikhan dikhise biswas nathaka nimite tai khan tate ghusi bole para nai. 1,,,,
"Therefore, since the promise of entering his rest is still allowed to stand, let us be careful that none of you may seem to have fallen short of it. 2","Itu nimite, Isor laga aram jaga te ghusi bo paribo laga kosom amikhan logote ase, hoilebi jodi kunba manu tate punchibole para nai eneka nohobo nimite amikhan bhoi pora rukhi thakibo. 2",,,,
For we were told the good news just as they were. But that message did not benefit those who did not unite in faith with those who obeyed.  3,"Kilemane tai khan ke koi diya nisena amikhan ke bi bhal khobor to koi dise. Kintu ki kotha koi dise itu pora tai khan nimite eku labh huwa nai, kilemane kun manu biswas pora hunise tai khan logote mon mili kena thaka nai. 3",,,,
"For we who have believed enter that rest, just as he said, ""As I swore in my wrath, They will never enter my rest."" Even so, his works were finished from the foundation of the world. 4","Kilemane amikhan biswas kora pora aram jagate ghusi bole parise, Tai pora kowa nisena, “Moi laga ghusa te kosom kha nisena, Tai khan Moi laga aram jaga te kitia bi ghusi bole naparibo.” Aru jodi bi, shristi shuru kora homoi pora Tai laga kaam sob pura korikena rakhise. 4",,,,

"And again in this same passage he said, ""They will never enter my rest."" 6","Aru bi eneka likha ase, “Tai khan Moi laga aram kora jaga te ghusi bole naparibo.” 6",,,,
"Therefore, it remains for some to enter that rest, and those who previously had the good news proclaimed to them did not go in because of their disobedience. 7","Itu karone, tate ghusi bole para kunba aru bi ase, aru kunba manu susamachar hunise hoile bi tai khan kotha namana nimite tate ghusi bole para nai. 7",,,,
"So God again appointed a certain day, calling it ""Today,"" when he spoke through David much later in words already quoted: ""Today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts."" 8","Isor pora ek din ke “Aji” mati dise. Bisi din pichete, Tai David logote kotha korise, age te kowa nisena, “Aji jodi tumi Tai laga awaj hunile, Apni laga mon tan nokoribi.” 8",,,,

So there remains a Sabbath rest reserved for God's people. 10,"Itu nimite, Isor laga manu nimite Bisram din rakhi ase. 10",,,,
"For he who enters into God's rest has himself also rested from his deeds, just as God did from his. 11","Kilemane kun Tai laga aram jaga te ghusi bole parise, tai nijor ke sob kaam pora aram pai loise, jineka Isor Tai laga kaam pora aram loi sele. 11",,,,

"For the word of God is living and active and sharper than any two-edged sword. It pierces even to the dividing of soul and spirit, of joints and marrow, and is able to discern the thoughts and intentions of the heart. 13","Kilemane Isor laga kotha to jinda aru dui phale dhar thaka talwar nisena kaam kore.

"No thing that has been created is hidden before God. Instead, everything is bare and open to the eyes of the one to whom we must give account. 14","Aru shristi te ki bonai kena thaka eku lukai kena nai. Kintu, sob khula-khuli ase aru Tai ke amikhan sob hisab dibole lage. 14",,,,
"Therefore, since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God, let us firmly hold to our confession. 15","Kilekoile amikhan logote mohan moha purohit ase, kun sorgo paar korikena ahise, Isor laga Chokra, Jisu, itu nimite amikhan biswas ke dhori lobo. 15",,,,
"For we do not have a high priest who cannot feel sympathy for our weaknesses. Instead, we have someone who has in all ways been tempted as we are, except that he is without sin. 16","Kilemane amikhan laga komjur nabujha laga moha purohit thaka nohoi, kintu amikhan nisena, Tai ke bi porikha korise, kintu Tai eku paap kora nai. 16",,,,
"Let us then go with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. 1","Itu nimite ahibi, ami khan mon dangor korikena Tai laga anugraha thaka singhason usorte jabo, eneka korile amikhan daya pabo aru dukh homoi te modot koribole anugrah pabo. 1",,,,
"For every high priest, chosen from among people, is appointed to act on the behalf of people in the things concerning God, so that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins. 2","Kilemane sob moha purohit khan ke manu majot pora basi loi, aru taikhan pora sob laga bodli te Isor ke uphar khan aru paap laga bolidan dibo nimite. 2",,,,

"Because of this, he also is required to offer sacrifices for his own sins, just as he does for the people's sins. 4","Itu nimite, Tai paap laga bolidan dibole lagise, Tai manu khan nimite kineka korise, itu nisena nijor nimite bi korise. 4",,,,
"It is not for himself that anyone takes this honor. Instead, he is called by God, just as Aaron was. 5","Tai nijor nimite kunba ke itu sonman lobole diya nai. Kintu Tai ke Isor pora mati loise, jineka Aaron ke mati loise le. 5",,,,
"In the same way, neither did Christ glorify himself by making himself high priest.

"It is just as he also says in another place, ""You are a priest forever after the manner of Melchizedek."" 7","Itu nisena dusra jaga te bi koi kena ase, “Tumi hodai nimite purohit ase Melchizedek laga pichete te.” 7",,,,
"During the days of his flesh, Christ offered up both prayers and requests with loud cries and tears to God, the one able to save him from death, and he was heard because of his godly life. 8","Khrista prithibi te jinda thaka homoi te, Tai suku pani giri jor pora kandi kena Tai ke mrityu pora bacha bole para ekjon ke prathana aru binti korise, aru Tai laga prathana huni loise kilemane Tai sidha mon pora mangise. 8",,,,
"Even though he was a Son, he learned obedience from what he suffered. 9","Aru Tai Isor laga chokra thakile bi, kineka kotha manibo lage, itu Tai laga ki dukh paise, itu pora Tai sikhise. 9",,,,
"He was made perfect and became, for everyone who obeys him, the cause of eternal salvation. 10","Tai sob pora bhal hoi jaise, aru kun manu Tai laga kotha mani kena thake, tai khan nimite sorgo te jabole laga rasta hoi jaise. 10",,,,
He was designated by God as high priest after the manner of Melchizedek. 11,"Aru Melchizedek pora kowa nisena, Tai ke Isor pora moha purohit bonai dise. 11",,,,

"For though by this time you should be teachers, you still have need for someone to teach you the elementary principles of God's messages. You need milk, not solid food! 13","Kilemane etiya laga homoi tak te tumi khan hikhok khan hobole lagise, kintu Isor laga kotha etiya tak tumikhan ke sikhai dibole lagi ase.

"For anyone who only takes milk is inexperienced with the message of righteousness, because he is still a little child. 14","Kilemane kun etiya bi dudh khai ase tai Isor laga dharmik kotha te komjur ase, kilemane tai etiya bi chutu bacha nisena ase. 14",,,,
But solid food is for the mature. These are those who because of their maturity have their understanding trained for distinguishing good from evil. 1,"Kintu tan bhat to dangor manu khan nimite ase, kilemane tai khan bhal aru biya to ki ase itu khan sob bhal pora jani kena sikhi loise. 1",,,,
"So then, let us leave the beginning of the message of Christ and move forward to maturity. Let us not lay again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God, 2","Itu nimite, Khrista laga shuru kotha ki ase, itu ke paar korikena dangor hoija manu khan nisena age te jabo.

"In this way, Abraham obtained what was promised after he had patiently waited. 16","Aru itu nisena he, Abraham dhorjo kori kena rukha karone, Isor pora tai ke ki kosom dise itu tai paise. 16",,,,

"Now clearly it is from Judah that our Lord was born, a tribe that Moses never mentioned concerning priests. 15","Amikhan bhal pora jani ase Probhu to Judah laga khandan pora ahise, aru Moses pora bi itu jat nimite eku kotha kora nai. 15",,,,
What we say is clearer yet if another priest arises in the likeness of Melchizedek. 16,"Aru itu ke arubi bhal pora buji bole asele, jodi kunba aru ekjon purohit Melchizedek nisena ulai. 16",,,,
"It was not based on a law of fleshly requirement that he became a priest, but instead was based on the power of an everlasting life. 17","Tai ekjon purohit hoise, khandan sai kena nohoi, kintu tai laga Tai laga namora jibon shakti sai kena tai ke purohit bonai se. 17",,,,
"For scripture witnesses about him: ""You are a priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."" 18",Kilemane Isor laga kotha te bi eneka gawahi di ase: “Tumi hodai nimite purohit ase Melchizedek laga niom hisab te.” 18,,,,
For not only has the former command been set aside because it is weak and useless— 19,"Purana niom aru kaam khan komjur aru eku kaam nathaka hoi ja-a pora hatai dise, 19",,,,
"for the law made nothing perfect—but also a better hope is introduced, through which we come near to God. 20","-niom aru kanun pora eku kaam to bhal bonai dibole napare-, aru bhal asha laga kotha to manu khan ke koi dise, itu pora amikhan Isor usorte ahe. 20",,,,
"And it was not without an oath! Others became priests without any oath, 21","Aru itu kaam kosom nakhai kena kora nai! Kilemane dusra khan to kosom noloi kena he purohit hoi jaise, 21",,,,
"but he became a priest through the oath-taking of the one who said to him, ""The Lord has sworn and he will not change his mind: 'You are a priest forever.'"" 22","kintu Jisu to kosom khai kena purohit hoise, Isor pora Tai ke koise, “Probhu pora kosom khaise aru Tai mon bodli nokoribo: ‘Tumi hodai nimite purohit ase.’” 22",,,,
By this also Jesus has given the guarantee of a better covenant. 23,"Itu nisena he, Jisu pora amikhan bhal kaam koribole nimite rasta khuli dise. 23",,,,
"The former priests were many in number, since death prevented them from continuing in office. 24","Prothom laga purohit khan bisi jon thakise, kintu mrityu hoi ja-a pora, tai khan kaam rukhi jaise. 24",,,,
"But because Jesus continues to live forever, he has a permanent priesthood. 25","Kintu Jisu hodai nimite jinda ase, Tai logot pora purohit laga kaam kitia bi naharabo. 25",,,,
"Therefore he is also able to save completely those who approach God through him, because he always lives to intercede for them. 26","Itu karone, kun manu pora Tai dwara Isor ke bisari kena ahe, Tai pora itu khan ke bacha bole pare, kilemane manu aru Isor majot te Tai hodai kotha kori di thake. 26",,,,
"For it was indeed fitting that we should have such a high priest, who is holy, innocent, pure, separated from sinners, and exalted above the heavens. 27","Eneka moha purohit thaka to amikhan nimite bhal ase. Tai pobitro ase, eku golti nai, sapha, paapi manu khan pora alag, aru Tai sorgo pora bi untcha hoi jaise. 27",,,,
"He does not need, unlike the high priests, to offer up daily sacrifices, first for his own sins, and then for the sins of the people. He did this once for all when he offered himself. 28","Tai ekjon moha purohit pora hodai kora nisena, poila tai nijor laga paap nimite, itu pichete manu laga paap nimite bolidan di thakibole eku dorkar nai. Kintu Tai nijor ke bolidan di kena, hodai nimite, ekbar te bolidan kori dise. 28",,,,
"For the law appoints as high priests men who have weaknesses. But the word of the oath, which came after the law, appointed a Son, who has been made perfect forever. 1","Kilemane kanun to komjur thaka khan majot pora he moha purohit koribole basi thake. Kintu kosom laga kotha, kun to kanun diya pichete ahise, itu pora Chokra ke basi loise, kun ke sob phale pora hodai nimite thik bonai dise. 1",,,,
Now the point of what we are saying is this: We have a high priest who has sat down at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens. 2,Etiya amikhan ki kobole mon ase itu laga motlob to hoile eneka ase: Amikhan logote moha purohit ase kun singhason laga dyna hath te sorgo laga mohan jagate bohi ase. 2,,,,
"He is a servant in the holy place, the true tabernacle that the Lord, not a man, set up. 3","Tai sob pora pobitro jaga te sewa kore juntu Probhu pora bonaise, manu pora nohoi. 3",,,,
For every high priest is appointed to offer both gifts and sacrifices. Therefore it is necessary to have something to offer. 4,Kilemane sob moha purohit khan ke uphar aru bolidan dibole nimite basi loise. Itu nimite tai bi kiba anikena boli dibole dorkar hoise. 4,,,,
"Now if Christ were on earth, he would not be a priest at all, since there are those who offer the gifts according to the law. 5","Etiya jodi Khrista prithibi te ase koile, Tai ekjon purohit nohobole thakise, kanun laga niom hisab te bolidan dibole nimite tate manu khan thakise. 5",,,,
"They serve a copy and shadow of the heavenly things. It is just as Moses was warned by God when he was about to construct the tabernacle: God said, ""See that you make everything according to the pattern that was shown to you on the mountain."" 6","Tai khan sorgo te thaka laga saya ki dikhi ase itu ke sewa kora he ase, jineka Moses ke Isor pora mana korise jitia tai aradhana kora laga jaga bona bole thakise. Kilemane, Isor he koise, “Sabi tumi ke pahar uporte loi jai kena kineka dikhai dise itu nisena he bonabi.” 6",,,,
"But now Christ has received a much better ministry, just as he is also the mediator of a better covenant, which is based on better promises. 7","Kintu etiya Khrista he bisi bhal porisorja to paise, jineka Tai manu aru Isor laga majote bhal vachan thaka laga kotha kori kena milai diya ekjon hoise. 7",,,,
"For if that first covenant had been faultless, no occasion for a second would have been sought. 8","Jodi prothom laga niom te eku golti nai koile, titia dusra niom dibole nimite eku dorkar thaka nai. 8",,,,
"For when God found fault with the people, he said, ""See, the days are coming—says the Lord— when I will make a new covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah. 9","Jitia Isor manu khan uporte golti dikhise, Tai koise, “Sabi, eneka din ahi ase- Probhu pora koise- Jitia Moi ekta notun niom bonai dibo Israel laga ghor aru Judah laga ghor logote. 9",,,,
"It will not be like the covenant that I made with their ancestors on the day that I took them by their hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt. For they did not carefully obey my covenant, and I disregarded them— says the Lord. 10","Aru itu vachan to Tai khan laga baba khan logote niom bonai diya nisena nohobo. Itu din te jitia tai khan laga hath dhori kena Egypt pora ulai kena loi anise. Kintu tai khan Moi laga niom to mani kena thaka nai, Aru Moi tai khan uporte khushi pa nai- Eneka Probhu pora koise. 10",,,,
"This is the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days —says the Lord. I will put my laws into their minds, and I will also write them on their hearts. I will be their God, and they will be my people. 11","Itu vachan ase Juntu Moi bonabo Israel laga ghor manu khan logote Itu din khan pichete - - Probhu koi ase. Moi laga kanun tai khan laga bhabona te rakhi dibo, Aru tai khan laga mon te likhi dibo. Moi tai khan laga Isor hobo, Aru tai khan Moi laga manu hobo. 11",,,,
"They will not teach each one his fellow citizen and each one his brother, saying, 'Know the Lord.' For they will all know me, from the least of them to the greatest. 12","Tai khan kitia bi nijor laga ghor usor thaka manu Aru kokai bhai khan ke nashikabo, aru kobo, ‘Probhu ke janibi.’ Kilemane tai khan Moi ke janibo, Sob se chutu pora loi kena sob se dangor tak. 12",,,,
"For I will be merciful toward their evil deeds, and their sins I will not remember any longer."" 13","Kilemane tai khan biya kaam kori kena thakise koile bi Moi tai khan uporte morom thakibo, Aru tai khan laga paap Moi aru kitia bi yaad nokoribo.” 13",,,,
"By calling this covenant ""new,"" he declared the first covenant to be old, and what has become old and obsolete will soon disappear. 1","Itu niom ke “notun” mata nisena, Tai pora prothom niom to bodli kori dise, aru kun to purana aru eku kaam nathake hoise, itu joldi harai jabo. 1",,,,
Now even the first covenant had regulations for worship and an earthly sanctuary. 2,Itu nisena prothom laga vachan te bi prithibi te aradhana kora ghor bonabole kanun thakise. 2,,,,
"For a tabernacle was prepared. The first, in which were the lampstand, the table, and the bread of the presence, was called the holy place. 3","Titia tombu ghor laga jaga taiyar korise. Poila kamra, kun jaga te deevat, mez, aru Isor laga agete daan rakhi diya roti rakhe, itu kamra ke sob pora pobitro jaga matise. 3",,,,
"Behind the second curtain was another tabernacle, called the most holy place. 4","Dusra purdah laga pichete aru bi dusra kamra thakise, aru itu ke pobitro pora bi bisi pobitro jaga matise. 4",,,,
"It had a golden altar for incense. It also had the ark of the covenant, which was completely overlaid with gold. Inside it was a golden jar that held the manna, Aaron's rod that budded, and the tablets of the covenant. 5","Tate dhuwa jolai kena aradhana koribole laga suna pora bona pobitro bedi thakise. Itu laga bhitor te vachan laga sandook thakise kuntu suna pora pura lipai kena thakise. Itu laga bhitorte suna pora bona kolsi ekta te manna rakhi thakise, aru Aaron laga lathi pora notun pata ulai kena thakise, aru vachan likhi rakha pathor, itu khan sob halikena thakise. 5",,,,
"Above the ark of the covenant, glorious cherubim overshadowed the atonement lid, which we cannot now talk about in detail. 6","Aru itu sandook laga uporte, mohima thaka Cherubim laga chaya pora sapha kori diya dhakna ke bondh kori kena thakise, kintu etiya itu kotha koi dibole homoi huwa nai. 6",,,,
"After these things were prepared, the priests always entered the outer room of the tabernacle to perform their services. 7","Jitia itu khan sob taiyar kori kena rakhi loise, titia he purohit khan hodai tombu ghor laga bahar kamra te tai khan laga sewa kaam khan kori thakise. 7",,,,
"But only the high priest entered the second room, once each year, and not without blood that he offered for himself and for the people's unintentional sins. 8","Kintu, khali moha purohit he, saal te ekbar, dusra kamra te ghusi kena, tai pora nijor nimite bolidan diya laga khun aru manu khan najani kena paap kora laga daan loikena jai. 8",,,,
The Holy Spirit showed that as long as the first tabernacle was still standing the way into the most holy place had not yet appeared. 9,Pobitro Atma pora sob pora pobitro jaga te jabole nimite rasta to dikhai diya nai jitia tak prothom laga tambu ghor khara kori thakise. 9,,,,
This was an illustration for the present time. Both the gifts and sacrifices that are now being offered are not able to perfect the worshiper's conscience. 10,"Etiya laga homoi nimite itu ekta chihna ase, juntu te uphar aru bolidan duijon dilebi aradhana kori thaka jon laga mon ekdom sapha koribole napare. 10",,,,
"They are only concerned with food and drink and various ceremonial washings, regulations for the body until the time of the new order. 11","Tai khan khali kha luwa aru nijor gaw ke sapha rakhibole laga niom khan, juntu poila pora thakise, itu khan te he mon di thakise jitia tak notun niom laga homoi aha nai. 11",,,,
"Christ came as a high priest of the good things that have come. He went through the greater and more perfect tabernacle that was not made by human hands, one not belonging to this created world.  12","Kintu bhal kaam sob nimite Khrista ekjon moha purohit hoi jaise. Etiya Tai sewa kori thaka tombu ghor to dangor aru bhal ase, itu manu laga hath pora bona nohoi, aru shristi laga bi nohoi. 12",,,,
"It was not by the blood of goats and calves, but by his own blood that he entered into the most holy place once for all and secured our eternal redemption. 13","Tai sob pora pobitro jaga te hodai nimite jaise, saguli aru guru laga bacha khun boli kori kena nohoi, kintu Tai nijor laga khun loikena amikhan karone anonto poritran ani dise. 13",,,,
"For if the blood of goats and bulls and the sprinkling of a heifer's ashes on those who have been defiled sanctifies them for the cleansing of their flesh, 14","Kilemane, jodi saguli aru mota goru laga khun aru bacha napa goru laga khun pora paap te giri kena letera thaka khan uporte hali diya pora taikhan Isor usorte alag rakhidiye koile, 14",,,,
"how much more will the blood of Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered himself unblemished to God, cleanse our conscience from dead works to serve the living God? 15","titia Khrista laga khun, jun anonto Atma pora nijor ke Isor usorte eku golti nathaki kena Tai laga jibon to bolidan kori dise, itu pora aru bi kiman mora laga kaam pora apni laga bhabona ke sapha kori dibo, jivit Isor ke sewa koribole nimite? 15",,,,
"For this reason, he is the mediator of a new covenant. This is so that, since a death has taken place for the redemption of those under the first covenant from their transgressions, those who are called will receive the promise of an eternal inheritance. 16","Itu karone, Tai manu aru Isor majote notun niom ase, itu pora kun ke mati loise tai khan anonto jibon laga asirbad pabo, prothom laga niom te paap pora maph pabole nimite ki niom thakise itu hatai kena Tai manu khan ke paap pora bachai dibole nimite nijor ke mori bole dise. 16",,,,
"For where there is a will, the death of the person who made it must be proven. 17","Kilemane, kitia manu itcha rakhe, tai mora pichete, itu itcha poila koikena thaka to kaam ahe. 17",,,,
"For a will is only valid when there has been a death, because it has no force while the one who made it is still alive. 18","Kilemane mora manu laga itcha likhi thaka to, tai mora pichete he kaam kore, kilekoile jitia tak itcha likha manu jinda ase, titia tak itu itcha kaam nadiye. 18",,,,
So not even the first covenant was established without blood. 19,Itu nimite prothom niom bi khun noloikena sthapit kora nai. 19,,,,
"For when Moses had given every command in the law to all the people, he took the blood of the calves and the goats, with water, red wool, and hyssop, and sprinkled both the scroll itself and all the people. 20","Jitia Moses pora manu khan logote niom laga hukum khan koi dise, tai saguli aru guru puwali laga khun, pani, lal suta aru hyssop logot loise aru kagos aru manu khan uporte chitai dise. 20",,,,
"Then he said, ""This is the blood of the covenant that God has commanded for you."" 21","Titia tai koise, “Itu Isor laga niom mana laga khun ase aru itu apni khan mani kena thakibole nimite hukum di ase.” 21",,,,
"In the same manner, he sprinkled the blood on the tabernacle and all the containers used in the ministry. 22","Itu nisena, tai tambu uporte khun hali dise aru tate chola laga kiman saman thakise, sob laga uporte hali dise. 22",,,,
"According to the law, almost everything is cleansed with blood. Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. 23","Niom laga hisab te sob to khun pora sapha kori dise, aru khun ulai kena nadiya tak paap pora maph napabo. 23",,,,
"Therefore it was necessary that the copies of the things in heaven should be cleansed with these animal sacrifices. However, the heavenly things themselves had to be cleansed with much better sacrifices. 24","Itu nimite eneka koribole dorkar hoise aru sorgote bi itu nisena kiman saman ase itu khan ke bi eneka pora he sapha koribole lagise. Hoile bi, sorgo te thaka saman khan to itu pora bi bhal bolidan pora sapha kori bole lagise. 24",,,,
"For Christ did not enter into the most holy place made with hands, which is only a copy of the true one. Instead he entered into heaven itself, to appear now in God's presence for us. 25","Kilemane Khrista bi hath pora bonai kena rakha sob pora pobitro jaga te ghusa nai, itu hosa ekjon laga sabole eke thaka dikhai diya he thakise. Kintu Tai nijor pora he sorgo te ghusi se, aru Isor laga usorte amikhan karone etiya jaga bonabole nimite jaise. 25",,,,
"He did not go there in order to offer himself many times, as does the high priest, who enters the most holy place year by year with the blood of another. 26","Tai tate aru nijor ke daan dibole nimite ghusa nai, moha purohit khan pora kora nisena, kun saal te ekbar sob pora pobitro jaga te khun laga bolidan loi kena ekjon-ekjon nimite ghusi thakise. 26",,,,
"If that had been the case, then he would have had to suffer many times since the foundation of the world. But now he has become visible at the end of the ages to do away with sin by the sacrifice of himself. 27","Jodi eneka he ase koile, Tai prithibi laga shuru pora bar-bar jai kena nijor ke dukh pabole nimite dibole thakise. Kintu Tai nijor pora ahi kena itu hekh yug te nijor jibon to manu khan nimite bolidan kori dise. 27",,,,
"Just as man is appointed to die once, and after that comes judgment, 28","Jineka manu bi ekbar moribole lage, aru itu pichete bisar kora laga homoi ahibo, 28",,,,
"so also, Christ was offered once to take away the sins of many, and will appear a second time, not to deal with sin, but for the salvation of those who are waiting for him. 1","itu nisena, Khrista ke bi manu laga paap bukhi bole nimite dise, aru ek bar ahibole ase kun manu Tai nimite pura mon pora rukhi ase, aru paap to bukhi bole nimite nohoi, kintu poritran dibole nimite ahibo. 1",,,,
"For the law is only a shadow of the good things to come, not the real forms of those things themselves. Those who approach God can never be made perfect by the same sacrifices that the priests continually bring year after year. 2","Kilemane niom khan to ki bhal ahibole ase itu khan he laga saya he ase, aru utu khan asol te kineka ase, itu khan to asol nohoi. Itu nimite, eke bolidan juntu purohit khan pora hodai saal-saal te diye, itu pora Isor logote ahise koile, tai khan kitia bi thik hobo naparibo. 2",,,,
"Otherwise, would the sacrifices not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers would have been cleansed one time and would no longer have any consciousness of sin. 3","Nohoile, bolidan kora to rukhi jabole thaka nai nohoi? Kilemane ek bar bolidan diya pora he manu khan sapha hoise, aru paap laga bhabona eku bi nathaka hoise. 3",,,,
But with those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year. 4,Kintu saal-saal pichete utu bolidan khan di thaka to taikhan laga paap thaka to yaad kori diya he ase. 4,,,,
For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins. 5,Kilemane saguli aru goru laga khun pora paap to sapha kori dibole napare. 5,,,,
"When Christ came into the world, he said, ""Sacrifices and offerings you did not desire, but a body you have prepared for me; 6","Itu nimite jitia Khrista prithibi te ahise, Tai koise, “Bolidan aru daan khan apni itcha nakore, Kintu ekta gaw Moi nimite taiyar kori diya to he itcha kore; 6",,,,
with burnt offerings and sin offerings you did not take pleasure. 7,Jolai kena daan kora aru paap laga daan diya pora apni khushi napai. 7,,,,
"Then I said, 'See, here I am— as it is written about me in the scroll— to do, God, your will.'"" 8","Titia moi koise, ‘Sabi Moi yate ase- Moi nimite kitab te likha nisena- apni laga kaam koribole nimite, O Isor.’” 8",,,,
"First he said, ""It was neither sacrifices, nor offerings, nor whole burnt offerings, nor sin offerings that you desired. Nor did you take pleasure in them."" These are sacrifices that are offered according to the law. 9","Tai itu khan kowa nisena, “Boli, aru daan, aru jolai kena diya daan, aru paap laga daan apni itcha nakore. Aru manu pora eneka kori thakile bi apni khushi napai” -niom hisab te daan di thaka-, 9",,,,
"Then he said, ""See, here I am to do your will."" He takes away the first practice in order to establish the second practice. 10","titia Tai koise, “Sabi, Moi yate apni laga itcha koribole nimite ase.” Tai shuru te ki niom kori thakise itu hatai kena dusra notun niom shuru kori dise. 10",,,,
"By that will, we have been sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all. 11","Itu laga itcha pora, amikhan ke Jisu Khrista laga gaw daan diya karone paap pora hodai nimite sapha kori dise. 11",,,,
"Day after day every priest stands and ministers, offering the same sacrifices again and again—sacrifices that can never take away sins. 12",Aru sob purohit khara kori kena hodai din Isor usorte tai laga niom kori thake. Tai bar-bar eke bolidan di thake - kintu itu bolidan kori thakile bi paap to kitia bi harai najai. 12,,,,
"But when Christ offered for all time one sacrifice for sins, he sat down at the right hand of God. 13","Kintu jitia Khrista pora sob paap laga boli ekbar pora di dise, Tai Isor laga dyna hath te bohise. 13",,,,
He is waiting until his enemies are made a footstool for his feet. 14,"Itu homoi pora, kitia Tai laga dushman khan ke theng nichete girai dibo Tai itu rukhi ase. 14",,,,
For by one offering he has perfected forever those who are being sanctified. 15,Ekta bolidan diya pora Tai sob ke paap pora hodai nimite sapha kori dise. 15,,,,
"The Holy Spirit also testifies to us. First he says, 16","Aru Pobitro Atma pora bi amikhan ke itu gawahi diye. Tai pora poila itu koise, 16",,,,
"""This is the covenant that I will make with them after those days, says the Lord. I will put my laws in their hearts, and I will write them on their minds."" 17","“Itu laga niom tai khan logote bonabo, Utu din pichete moi, Probhu pora koi ase.

"Then he adds, ""Their sins and lawless deeds I will remember no longer."" 18","Aru titia, “Tai khan laga paap aru biya kaam khan aru moi yaad nokoribo.” 18",,,,
"Now where there is forgiveness for these, there is no longer any sacrifice for sin. 19","Jun jaga te itu khan pora maph pabo, tate aru paap laga bolidan dibole nimite dorkar nai. 19",,,,
"Therefore, brothers, we have confidence to enter into the most holy place by the blood of Jesus. 20","Itu karone, bhai khan, Jisu laga khun dwara amikhan sob pora pobitro jaga te jabole nimite pura asha ase. 20",,,,

"Because we have a great priest over the house of God, 22","Kilemane Isor laga ghor te amikhan laga ekjon dangor purohit ase, 22",,,,
"let us approach with true hearts in the full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and having our bodies washed with pure water. 23","ami khan sapha mon aru pura biswas pora Tai logote ahibo, paap laga bhabona pora sapha koribo aru sapha pani pora nijor laga gaw dhulai lobo. 23",,,,

"For if we deliberately go on sinning after we have received the knowledge of the truth, a sacrifice for sins no longer remains. 27","Jodi amikhan hosa kotha to jani kena pichete bi paap kaam kori kena jai thakile, titia hoile paap nimite bolidan diya to hoile apni nimite eku kaam nohobo. 27",,,,

Anyone who has rejected the law of Moses dies without mercy at the testimony of two or three witnesses. 29,"Kun manu Moses laga kanun namani kena thake, tai khan to daya napai kena duijon tinjon laga gawahi pora morai diye. 29",,,,
"How much worse punishment do you think one deserves who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, who treated the blood of the covenant as unholy—the blood by which he was sanctified—and insulted the Spirit of grace? 30","Kun manu Isor laga Chokra ke theng nichete chipai dise, jun ke paap pora sapha kori dise, aru tai Isor laga pobitro khun pora bonai rakha vachan ke ninda korise aru anugraha Atma ke opman kori dise, taikhan laga saja to kiman bi dangor hobo? 30",,,,
